# Migration Scripts

This directory is reserved for migration-related PowerShell scripts.

## Purpose

Migration scripts are used for:
- Database migrations
- Server migrations
- Application migrations
- Infrastructure migrations

## Examples

Typical migration scripts might include:
- Data migration from legacy systems
- Server configuration migrations
- Application deployment migrations
- Infrastructure-as-Code migrations

## Usage

Migration scripts should follow these best practices:

1. **Idempotency**: Scripts should be safe to run multiple times
2. **Rollback**: Include rollback procedures
3. **Validation**: Pre-flight and post-migration validation
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all actions
5. **Dry-Run**: Support `-WhatIf` mode for testing

## Status

This folder is currently a placeholder for future migration scripts.
